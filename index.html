  <h2> Grizzles vs Jazz </h2>
  
  <p>The Jazz are moving on to bigger things while the Grizzlies are moving back to Beale Street after Utah’s 126-110 romp in Game 5. This first-round series went a quick five games, and probably could’ve been a sweep if Mitchell had made his first appearance in the opener and not Game 2. </p>

  <p>Last year, first round? There was suspense. The Utah Jazz went the limit against the Denver Nuggets and Donovan Mitchell went next level, posting games of 57, 51, 44 and 
30 points in that series. However, Utah lost in Game 7 by two points and everyone who watched and participated in that series needed a warm towel and a cold drink when it was over.</p>
